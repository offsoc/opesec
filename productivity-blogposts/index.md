As you can probably tell, productivity is also something passionate about, because i think it's paramount to make sure that you effectively accomplish what your life is about.

You should realize what your life is truly meant to be about, your clarity about it must always remain, you must never forget what the right path is, and never ever deviate from it.

We're all here for a limited amount of time, do you seriously think you have time to waste with pointless addictions? Come back to reality. Restore clarity, because you're here for a very small amount of time. You better ONLY do what truly matters to you, and stick to it enough to actually make it a reality while you're still alive.

There is an entire approach to Productivity, from restoring health, clarity, to figuring out what your life is about, to visualize it, plan it out, schedule it, to actually do the work, review it, and continuously improve how efficiently you achieve your goals.
