## **Why make graphs ?**

Because a well-written graph is worth a thousand words, you are conveying the same amount of information in one image, than you would convey in 20 lines of explanations. It is also something that you need to do in order to not loose your viewers' focus. Especially if they are not on the same technical level as you. 

## **How to make Graphs**

If you are showcasing a complex tutorial please put into a graph what you are talking about. I used to make graphs using yEd Graphs (but it's closed source) so instead as of q3 2024 i'm using Drawio to make them, both tools have got everything you need to write complex graphs.

If you want to use my logos for onymity, surveillance, centralisation, complexity, etc you can find them in the **the-opsec-bible/opsec/logos/** directory:

Then, i'll let you go through the [drawio documentation](https://www.drawio.com/doc/) to learn how to use it, as there's alot to cover to add logos, change shapes, add text, add arrows, etc:

And in the end you can make good looking graphs like this one:

And that's it! You just made it easier for your readers to understand what you want to convey to them, and you're not loosing half of your potential viewers on unecessary walls of text.
