# **Sugar is public enemy #1**

### Sugar (especially refined) is the worst thing to eat because it is a poison to your body.   
  
It is a simple carbohydrate that is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream, causing a spike in blood sugar levels. This can lead to a number of health problems, including: 

#### 

  * Weight gain: Sugar is a high-calorie food that can contribute to weight gain if it is consumed in excess.
  

  * Type 2 diabetes: Sugar can increase your risk of developing **type 2 diabetes** by causing insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. When you eat sugar, your body produces insulin to help lower your blood sugar levels. However, if you eat too much sugar, your body can become resistant to insulin, which can lead to type 2 diabetes.
  

  * Heart disease: Sugar can increase your risk of developing heart disease by raising your blood pressure abnormally and bad cholesterol levels.
  

  * Stroke: Sugar can increase your risk of having a stroke by damaging the blood vessels in your brain.
  

  * Cancer: Sugar can increase your risk of developing cancer by promoting the growth of cancer cells.
  

  * Tooth decay: Sugar is a major cause of tooth decay. When you eat sugar, the bacteria in your mouth feed on it and produce acids that can damage your teeth. This can also rarely result in decay of nerves in the mouth and worse consequences.



###   
  
The worst part about sugar (and also many "anti-depressants" - more on them later) is instant gratification.   
  
It is like putting a band-aid on a deep wound and telling that it'll heal. It will not.   
** Sugar intake triggers the release of dopamine - the 'feel good hormone'.   
  
However, the sudden increase in blood-sugar levels are coupled with insulin, which decreases the amount of blood-sugar level, that dips down the already dropping dopamine level.   
  
Continuous cycles of this leads to what's called the "Dopamine Baseline Level" increasing more than decreasing. This causes your body to get used to high levels of dopamine - which is directly related to happiness, motivation, desire for hard work, and good mental health. 

  
  


###  Therefore, in a nutshell, the greater the sugar (high dopamine) intake, the more that the baseline bloats, so the tasks that felt rewarding are now way less rewarding. As a result, you now want more sweets to feel good than earlier, you want more 'junk food' to feel good than earlier, and so on. 

  
  


### The graph below tries to illustrate how it works.

_Sidenote:_ daily [cold exposure](../coldshowers/index.md) improves glucose and lipid metabolism, on top of enhancing insulin sensitivity, which reduces risk factors associated with metabolic diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

## **(cis, unsaturated) Fats are good for you**

####  Now that the sugar is our of our way, we are already very healthy. Now its time to gain healthy energy instead of the unhealthy one that sugar gives. 

  


## Benefits of unsaturated fats

### 

  * Improving brain function: Unsaturated fats are essential for brain development and function.
  

  * _They can help to improve memory, learning, and mood._ They are directly responsible for the cognitive speed of your brain as they enhance the transmission of electric signals among neurons.
  

  * _Reducing the risk of cancer:_ Unsaturated fats have been shown to reduce the risk of some types of cancer, such as breast cancer and colon cancer.
  

  * _Improving bone health:_ Unsaturated fats can help to improve bone health by increasing the absorption of calcium.



  
  


### Essential fatty acids (EFAs) like 'Omega 3', 'Omega 6' are crucial for cognitive (thinking, learning, remembering, logical analysis) functions of the brain.   
  
Omega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are important for brain development and function, and they have been shown to protect against cognitive decline.   
  
Omega-6 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are important for the production of hormones and other signaling molecules. 

## **Cholestrol is bad for you!!.......................right..?**

### One of the biggest lies we've been told is that cholestrol is bad for you. You might've heard doctors say that it clogs your arteries and that you should avoid cholestrol at all costs.

  
  


### Let me list the things cholesterol is actual responsible for.

#### 

  1. Sex hormones - Testosterone (& derivatives) and Estrogen (& derivatives)
  

  2. Reduces various types of Cancers
  

  3. Protects brain from internal damage
  

  4. Essential for many bodily functions, including other hormones' production and cell growth
  

  5. Decreasing inflammation (especially the one caused by bad (shit) seed oils and our dear poison - Sugar)

## **Critical Note**

#### When you eat a lot of carbohydrates (explaination coming up), the fats you eat are stored in the body as reserve energy, which realistically, in today's day and age, we don't need.   
  
This localisation of fats (near gut and face in males, near thighs and over the time near mammary glands in females) is often indicated by low LDL (chemical that transports cholesterol and fat around) yet high cholestrol; that is, there's fat being moved around the blood but is not used, thus it often gets clogged in the arteries and bulks up as what we know as fats, in front of the belly.   
  
Because doctors are trained by schools affiliated with Big Pharma (we'll talk about in a bit), their immediate reaction to this is to decrease fats and increase carbs (carbohydrates) in your diet.   
  
Your body prefers burning carbohydrates because carbohydrates (including sugars) have high energy density than proteins and need less power to break down than fats. However, the energy gained from burning the carbohydrates is unclean energy and the side products are often bad for you.   
  
When you start eating even more carbohydrates and decrease the amount of fat, all you're doing is keeping the old fat in its place and adding more fat to the pile, all while burning more dirty energy.   
  
However, what the big pharma (+ google) does not tell you is that the best way to get rid of _body fat_ and the cholestrol clog in your arteries, is decrease the amount of carbohydrates you eat _**drastically**_.   
  
This stops the body from 1. Burning dirty energy, and 2. Start using up the fat reserve and start moving the cholestrol and fats with the help of LDL.   
  
As we talked about fats being more energy dense and cleaner than carbohydrates, your body now burns fats without feeling heavily lathargic. This also unclogs the arteries because now your body is in a state of burning fats for energy and it needs as much fats as it can to burn and give you energy.   
  
Some people unfortunately, are born with really rare genetic mutation where they can not digest healthy plant-based cholestrols/oils (sitosterol/Beta-sitosterol) from sources like Avocado and Olive and end up clogging it up in the arteries. Again, this is SUPER RARE and you probably do not have it unless you had to go to a doctor and the doctor said that to you.

## **"Food Pyramid" - the most successful business campaign**

  
![](food-pyramid1.jpg)   
  


###  After what was said earlier about fats being essential and the only way to not have body fat and feel lathargic while also having a sane functioning non-brain-foggy focused mind is to drastically decrease the carbohydrate intake and increase the (healthy) fat intake, have a very close look to the pyramid.   
  
What does it say? 

#### 
* Mostly eat carbohydrates.
* Eat really less amounts of fats.
* _Eat less salt_ (more on that below).

  
  


## **Big Pharma's Deception**

### If this wasn't enough, lets look at how the "normal levels" of certain things in our blood have changed in just 40 years.

  
![](normal-levels.png)

#### I have people running after me telling me that all of this is alright and that even if they (organisations) are affiliated with pharmaceutical companies, they wouldn't lie.   
  
They said the same thing about our privacy btw. Yet here we are. 

# **Preparing the body**

  


### Now that we have understood the reality of the necessary macronutrients and how we should not blindly let a company control our health, lets look at how do we successfully implement it

  
  


## Lets go through how you can improve your diet step-by-step:

### 

  1. Cutting out the Sugar. (You can lower your sugar consumption by eating Fruits instead)
  

  2. Do some amount of Cardiovascular exercise (minimum 150 - 180 minutes per week). See [Yoga Angamardhana](../yoga/index.md) for that.
  

  3. Get at least 15 minutes of [cold exposure](../coldshowers/index.md) every week. This will also aid in the cellular cleansing by reinforcing your immune system.
  

  4. Calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI)
  

  5. Take a Blood test [CBC/Cholestrol/Blood-sugar/Sex-hormone] (check with a nutritionist or a doctor for accurate advice on what you may immediately need to regain balance) 
  

  6. Get enough ample and quality sleep every night, it is an absolute requirement for everything health-related.
  



# **How to eat properly**

First of all the most important part is the meal frequency: **2 meals per day at the most**. Eat once at noon, and Eat once in the evening. **No snacking, no breakfast.** That is because you want your body to actually naturally cleanse itself on the cellular level, the cancerous cells are consumming much more than regular cells, hence by intentionally spacing out your meals you are starving off all the cells that shouldn't eat more than they should. **You cannot go through this natural cleansing without having an empty stomach** , this is essential to prevent cancerous cells from forming within you. 
    
    
    -6h00: Waking up
    
    -12h00: Lunch Time (food)
    
    -19h00: Dinner time (food)
    
    -22h00: Sleep
    
    

That means you sleep hungry, and wake up hungry, and this is totally intentional **because your body and brain work at their best only when your stomach is empty.** In my above recommendation, we are leaving a total of 15 hours gap between Dinner time and the next day's Lunch time.

You need to experiment with food. Just check how long you are digesting a certaint type of food, and if you are alive and energetic after digesting it. **If your body feels like it wants to go the grave after eating something** and you feel like you can't function properly after digesting, **your body is clearly telling you that this is not good food** , it is having a hard time with it.

You can't just buy a petrol car and pump diesel into it. While it may still roll around haphazardly, **you want to function at your best, so you need to use the right fuel for this body and brain.** The requirement is not what tastes good, but rather: 

  1. **How long does the digestion take ?**

  2. **How friction-free is the digestion ?**

  3. **How energetic and alive your body feels after digesting it ?**




You will see after experimenting a bit, that **your body digests best what is furthest away from you from an evolutionnary perspective.** Try out eating only meat for one meal and observe how your body feels, based off the above 3 criterias. You'll see that it takes forever to digest that kind of food, the body will be dragged down by the inertia caused by the digestion itself, and you won't feel energetic at all you'll most likely want to sleep (even though you cannot properly sleep and properly digest at the same time). And as a counter example, see how your body feels after eating what i recommend below:

If your **body feels agile and alive** and it **doesn't take long to digest** , your body is telling you that **this is good food** because it is not building up inertia, but rather it is making it feel alive and well. Inertia is not what you are looking for when you want to live, as death basically is total inertia. You need aliveness, energy and agility.

On top of that, the more intertia you make your body go through while eating, the more you will need to sleep for your body to repair the damage done that has been done. But if you eat the right kind of food, your sleep quota will go down, as there will be less damage done to the body, meaning less maintenance to do on the body, meaning less sleep will be required.

  1. **_Fruits_ : the best possible fuel for your body**, your body digests them very quickly (**30 mins digestion time**) and your body feels alive and agile afterward. There is sugar in nearly all fruits out there, so you can use fruits to cut down your sugar intake to the strict necessary.

![](fruits.png)
  2. **_Vegetables:_ the next best fuel for your body**, your body also digests them faily quickly (**45-60mins digestion time**) and leaving your body feeling well afterward.

![](vegetables.png)
  3. _Eggs:_ Great for cholesterol (without raising the risk of heart disease), proteins, choline (another essential nutrient for brain health), and Vitamins A, B12, B2, B5, and more. (**30 mins digestion time**)

![](eggs.png)
  4. _Essential Fatty Acids, Fossil Lipids and EPAs:_ **That also includes eating Fish in general, Fish oil, Chia seeds, Walnuts, Soybeans, Olive oil, Coconut oil**. This will do wonders for your neuron membranes. These are the aforementionned Omega Sixes and Omega Threes, which are essential for your brain health. (**1h30 digestion time**)

![](fish.png)
  5. _Organic Ground Nuts:_ (soak them in water for 5 hours) to clean them. Then peel them. this is a rich source of protein (yes, you don't need meat for proteins), fat and fiber. (**1h30 digestion time**)

![](nuts.png)
  6. _Water:_ That's an obvious one, as approximately 70% of your body is water after all. **But only consume water either before eating, or after the digestion has finished.** don't just eat and drink at the same time, as the water will make the digestion longer than it should be. Above all this is why Fruits are the best possible fuel as they contain water, and this on the other hand actually helps with the digestion. Now don't just drink a fixed amount of water, listen to your body. If it is thirsty, you must drink enough water to quench that thirst, without interfering with the food digestion. 

![](water.png) 


Don't forget to eat diversely, as this is vital for **your overall gut health (and gut microbiome)** so dont hesitate to eat different types of fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish, etc. This will help support digestion, nutrient metabolism, energy expenditure, regulating hormones secretion, modulating your immune system, and influencing your brain function (yes, there is a strong [connection between your gut and your brain](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/the-brain-gut-connection), believe it or not) and emotional wellbeing.

And that's it! Now you should have enough advice on how to improve how you eat, remember to experiment with food and to carefully listen to what your body is saying about it when digesting it, and how it feels after digesting it.
