# Solitary Confinement

```
TLDR: you can get legally tortured by being sent to solitary confinement
```

## Introduction

If your behavior is deemed "bad" by the general population, you could end up being punished by the government. As you may already know, governments likes to impose penalties on those who oppose them or behave in ways they consider "unnormal". Punishments can range from fines and prison sentences to death or solitary confinement. Today, we'll discuss solitary confinement (SHU) and its effects on those who endure it.

![](room.png)

## What is solitary confinement? 

The official definition of solitary confinement is as follows: "*Solitary confinement (or simply solitary) is a form of imprisonment where a person is held in a single cell with little to no contact with others. It's used as a punitive measure within the prison system to discipline or isolate individuals considered security risks to others or prison staff, as well as those who break facility rules or cause disruptions. However, it can also serve as protective custody for inmates whose safety is at risk from other prisoners, isolating them from the general population to prevent harm or death.*"

One important aspect that's missing from this official definition is that solitary confinement is also a form of legal torture. While the definition doesn't mention it, this idea will be explored further in the post. The concept of torture is crucial because the [negative](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/solitary-confinement-effects) impacts of solitary confinement often far outweigh any potential benefits.

![](effects.png)

Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that solitary confinement was implemented not just as a punitive measure but also as a tool to enhance state control over prisoners. Given its severe impact on mental and physical health, it can be used as a method of manipulation. For example, solitary confinement is frequently employed prior to trials to coerce confessions from detainees, capitalizing on the intense psychological stress it induces. In addition, solitary confinement is widely used as a tool to suppress protests.

Solitary confinement was introduced in the late 18th century as an alternative to public punishment. From the very beginning, the mental health consequences were well-known, yet the system persisted and spread across the globe.

## What solitary confinement does to you? 

As mentioned, solitary confinement is considered a form of legal torture. This punishment has significant effects on both physical and mental health. Numerous studies have already demonstrated these impacts, and we will explore them from both a [physical](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7546459/) and [mental](https://neurolaunch.com/solitary-confinement-and-mental-health/) perspective.

### Physical

#### Sleep Disturbances:

Many individuals in solitary confinement experience severe disruptions in sleep patterns, including insomnia, nightmares, and reduced [REM](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/stages-of-sleep/rem-sleep) sleep. This can lead to chronic fatigue and affect overall health.

#### Weakened Immune System:

Extended isolation can compromise the [immune](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8264770/) system, making individuals more susceptible to illness. The stress of confinement can increase inflammation in the body, further weakening immune responses.

![](immune.png)

#### Physical Deterioration:

Lack of physical activity in solitary confinement leads to muscle [atrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_atrophy), poor circulation, and other physical health issues, like joint pain and weakness. Individuals in solitary often do not have access to exercise or movement, which can worsen physical health over time. Charles Bronson, who spent three decades in solitary confinement, wrote a [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1906459.Solitary_Fitness) dedicated to avoid these effects. 

#### Chronic Pain:

Some studies show that prolonged isolation can lead to chronic pain conditions, including headaches, back pain, and abdominal pain, which are often linked to the physical effects of confinement and stress.

![](pain.png)

#### Hormonal Imbalance:

Long-term stress can cause hormonal imbalances, particularly in cortisol levels. Chronic exposure to high [cortisol](https://drfarrahmd.com/2025/05/understanding-high-cortisol-levels-causes-symptoms-and-complications/) levels (the stress hormone) can lead to various issues, such as weight gain, muscle weakness, and increased risk of chronic diseases.

### Heightened Risk of Suicide:

The despair caused by isolation can increase the [likelihood](https://www.vera.org/news/study-links-solitary-confinement-to-increased-risk-of-death-after-release) of self-harm and suicidal tendencies, making those in solitary confinement more vulnerable to life-threatening physical harm.

![](after.png)

### Mental

#### Severe Anxiety and Panic Attacks:

The constant stress and uncertainty in solitary confinement can lead to heightened anxiety. Individuals often experience [panic](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/10/solitary) attacks, characterized by intense feelings of fear and discomfort.

#### Depression and Emotional Distress:

A lack of [social](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/05/ce-corner-isolation) interaction and sensory deprivation can lead to feelings of profound sadness, hopelessness, and depression. Many inmates report a loss of interest in life or a sense of emotional numbness.

![](depression.png)

#### Cognitive Decline:

Prolonged isolation can impair [cognitive](https://neurolaunch.com/effects-of-solitary-confinement-on-the-brain/) functions, including memory, attention, and decision-making. Some individuals may also experience difficulty concentrating or feel mentally "foggy."

#### Hallucinations and Paranoia:

Sensory deprivation, along with isolation, can result in vivid [hallucinations](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-17955-001) (auditory or visual) and increased paranoia. The mind may begin to create experiences or delusions to fill the void left by the lack of external stimuli.

![](hallucinations.png)

#### Psychotic Disorders:

In extreme cases, solitary confinement can induce or exacerbate psychotic [disorders](https://medlineplus.gov/psychoticdisorders.html), including hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. These conditions can sometimes become permanent even after release from solitary confinement.

#### Emotional and Behavioral Instability:

Inmates often exhibit heightened irritability, aggression, and emotional [instability](https://foundationsgroupbehavioralhealth.com/blog/signs-of-mentally-unstable-person/). The inability to cope with isolation can cause emotional outbursts or violent behavior.

![](emotional.png)

#### Loss of Identity:

The absence of social interaction and structure can lead to a loss of personal [identity](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/articles/i-dont-know-who-i-am-anymore-losing-my-identity). Over time, individuals may feel disconnected from themselves and their past lives, often struggling to adjust once released.

#### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD):

Many individuals who experience prolonged solitary confinement develop symptoms similar to [PTSD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967), including flashbacks, nightmares, and hyperarousal. The trauma of isolation can leave long-lasting scars, affecting a person's mental well-being long after release.

![](ptsd.png)

In 1983, Stuart Grassian [described](https://journals.library.wustl.edu/lawpolicy/article/843/galley/17678/view/) the SHU Syndrom, as a "*major, clinically distinguishable psychiatric syndrome*". Despite the comprehensive studies conducted by numerous professionals, solitary confinement remains widely used around the world and continues to be one of the most severe forms of torture inflicted on humans.

## Where is solitary confinement used? 

To be fair, since solitary confinement is still used in all countries worldwide, we will focus here on those that are beginning to discuss its limitations.

Solitary confinement is considered a form of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by many international human rights organizations, but it's still legal in all countries. However, there are some countries where solitary confinement has been discussed or heavily restricted, especially for certain groups of people like juveniles, the mentally ill, or those who are held for extended periods.

If you want to explore how solitary confinement is handled word wide, please refer to this [website](https://solitaryconfinement.org/) that give really detailed information. A lot of information below were found on it. 

Here's a list of some countries where solitary confinement is restricted:

#### Norway

Norway has some of the most progressive prison [policies](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/_files/ugd/Mapping-Solitary-Confinement-Norway.pdf). Solitary confinement is prohibited for juveniles, and there are strict regulations on its use for adults, especially when it comes to its duration and conditions. The use of solitary confinement for extended periods is considered a violation of human rights.

![](norway.png)

#### Denmark

Denmark also [restricts](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/_files/ugd/Mapping-Solitary-Confinement-Denmark.pdf) the use of solitary confinement, particularly for vulnerable individuals, such as minors and those with mental health issues. It is illegal to use solitary confinement for minors in the Danish prison system.

#### Belgium

In Belgium, the use of solitary confinement is highly [regulated](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/_files/ugd/Mapping-Solitary-Confinement-Belgium.pdf) and is only permitted in exceptional cases. It is often prohibited for vulnerable individuals, including juveniles, and can only be used for short durations and under strict supervision.

![](trauma.png)

#### The Netherlands

The Netherlands has placed significant [restrictions](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/solitary-in-the-netherlands) on solitary confinement, particularly for minors and mentally ill prisoners. While it is not outright banned, its use is highly controlled.

#### Iceland

Iceland has a progressive [approach](https://www.amnesty.org/en/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/EUR2853522022ENGLISH.pdf) to prison reform, and solitary confinement is heavily restricted, especially for juveniles and those with mental illnesses.

![](deathII.png)

#### Germany

In Germany, solitary confinement is [regulated](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/07/opinion/what-we-learned-from-german-prisons.html) by law, and its use is restricted, especially for juveniles and people with mental disorders. The duration is also limited by law.

#### Portugal

Portugal is one of the European countries that has placed [limitations](https://www.ohchr.org/en/meeting-summaries/2020/03/dialogue-portugal-human-rights-committee-discusses-racial-discrimination) on the use of solitary confinement, particularly for individuals with mental health issues and juveniles.

![](where.png)

#### Chile

In 2018, [Chile](https://solitaryconfinement.org/map/solitary-confinement-in-chile) passed a law banning the use of solitary confinement for minors and restricted its use for adults, particularly in cases where individuals are mentally ill.

#### South Africa

South Africa has made [strides](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/_files/ugd/Mapping-Solitary-Confinement-South-Africa.pdf) in limiting the use of solitary confinement. Although it is still used in some instances, it has been heavily restricted, particularly in cases involving juveniles or individuals with mental health conditions.

#### Canada

Canada has imposed [limitations](https://www.solitaryconfinement.org/_files/ugd/Mapping-Solitary-Confinement-Canada-Federal-System.pdf) on the use of solitary confinement, especially in the context of its correctional system. In 2019, the country introduced new legislation to limit the use of solitary confinement and reduce its duration.

![](canada.png)


As you can see, even in countries that are restricting its use, solitary confinement is still prevalent worldwide. It remains a powerful tool for government control, and many are unwilling to remove it from their arsenal. Some governments acknowledge that it violates human rights and may publicly claim to be taking a progressive stance, but in the end, people continue to be legally tortured.

Solitary confinement usage can even vary from a state to another in the same country. Here is an example for the United States of America: 

![](usa.png)

The restrictions that have been applied are primarily aimed at appeasing human rights organizations, without truly limiting the use of solitary confinement.

## How to handle solitary confinement? 

Since you can be sent to solitary confinement without prior warning, governments are highly skilled at implementing it unexpectedly, it's crucial to prepare yourself by learning about it before it happens, because once it does, it may be too late.

Regarding the physical decline caused by a lack of activity in isolation, I've already shared the book written by Bronson with you. In my opinion, it offers the best insight into how to combat muscular atrophy. Despite spending three decades in solitary confinement, Bronson never experienced it.

![](book.png)

Regarding the other aspects, here are a few key pieces of advice drawn from studies on the effects of solitary confinement on individuals:

#### Develop Mental Resilience:

Practice mindfulness or [meditation](https://www.mesmerizeapp.com/blog/conquer-stress-dive-into-best-15-meditative-techniques): Mindfulness practices can help you remain calm and focused, reducing the negative impact of stress. Meditation techniques, such as focusing on your breath, can allow you to distance yourself from feelings of despair or panic, which are common in solitary confinement.

Visualization techniques: According to psychologist Craig [Haney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Haney) in his research, using visualization to imagine yourself outside your current situation can help maintain a sense of hope and agency.

**Tip**: Start practicing mindfulness or meditation regularly way before you enter solitary confinement. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you in establishing a daily habit.

![](resilience.png)

#### Build Physical Strength:

Regular physical exercise: Even if you're confined to a small space, regular [bodyweight](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/the-42-best-bodyweight-exercises-the-ultimate-guide-for-working-out-anywhere/) exercises like push-ups, squats, or isometric exercises can help maintain muscle mass and circulation. This was highlighted in Charles Bronson's experience, where despite spending decades in solitary, he never suffered from muscular atrophy due to his intense workout routines.

Create a simple exercise routine: Before confinement, familiarize yourself with exercises that require little or no space. Consider routines that focus on strength, flexibility, and endurance.

**Tip**: Building muscle memory and a routine can ensure you can exercise even under the most restrictive conditions.

![](strengh.png)

#### Cultivate Mental Engagement:

Mental stimulation: Engage in activities that challenge your mind, such as reading, writing, or mental exercises like puzzles or problem-solving games. Keeping the mind engaged can prevent cognitive decline, which is common in long-term isolation.

Create a mental [library](https://martinboss.com/newsletter/my-mental-library/): If you are allowed to bring books or have access to written material, focus on reading and memorizing texts to keep your mind active. Studies show that a lack of intellectual engagement can significantly impair cognitive function over time.

**Tip**: Memorize poetry, historical facts, or stories in advance to give yourself mental material to work with while in isolation.

![](brain.png)

#### Develop Coping Mechanisms for Stress:

Breathing exercises: Controlled breathing [techniques](https://www.healthline.com/health/breathing-exercise), such as deep diaphragmatic breathing, can help control anxiety and stress. Studies have shown that focusing on your breath can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, helping to calm the body's response to fear and anxiety.

Create a self-soothing routine: If possible, create a routine of [self-soothing](https://positivepsychology.com/self-soothing/) behaviors that you can engage in regularly, such as mentally revisiting positive memories or using calming visualizations.

**Tip**: Practice deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation techniques before confinement, so they become second nature during times of stress.

![](coping.png)

#### Prepare for the Sensory Deprivation:

Learn to cope with sensory [deprivation](https://neurolaunch.com/sensory-deprivation-psychology/): In solitary confinement, the lack of sensory input (such as light, sound, and human interaction) can lead to psychological distress. Research suggests that exposure to natural light and maintaining a regular sleep schedule can help mitigate some of the effects of sensory deprivation.

Develop sensory techniques: In the absence of external stimuli, you can create mental stimulation through visualization or memory exercises.

**Tip**: Before confinement, practice closing your eyes and imagining vivid scenes or landscapes, and use this technique when deprived of external sensory inputs.

![](deprivation.png)

#### Foster Emotional Resilience:

Cultivate emotional control: Emotional [regulation](https://positivepsychology.com/emotion-regulation/) is essential to prevent feelings of anger, hopelessness, or despair. Learn to identify your emotions and practice techniques to manage them, such as journaling or using self-talk.

Maintain a sense of purpose: Many people in solitary confinement lose their sense of purpose, which exacerbates the psychological impact. Finding ways to give yourself meaning and purpose during isolation (such as setting small goals or keeping track of your progress) can help you maintain mental clarity.

**Tip**: Start journaling now, even if it's just a few sentences a day. This practice can help you express emotions, track your thoughts, and stay connected to your sense of self.

![](dimensions.png)

#### Understand the Legal and Human Rights Framework:

Know your rights: Understanding your legal rights regarding solitary confinement, and the international human rights standards that protect against torture, can help empower you. The [Mandela](https://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/Nelson_Mandela_Rules-E-ebook.pdf) Rules specifically address the issue of solitary confinement and set guidelines on how long it should last and under what conditions.

Use available legal resources: If you are in a country that offers legal assistance, make sure you are informed about your right to challenge solitary confinement.

**Tip**: Familiarize yourself with the Mandela Rules and the rights of prisoners under international law. This knowledge can be valuable if you ever find yourself in a position to challenge your confinement.

![](mandela.png)

#### Build a Support System (If Possible):

Stay connected (if possible): If there are opportunities to communicate with others, whether through letters, visits, or brief moments of interaction, maintain those connections. [Research](https://www.psychiatry.org/News-room/APA-Blogs/Social-Connections-Key-to-Maintaining-Mental-Well) has shown that even limited social contact can significantly improve mental well-being.

Leverage outside support: Prior to confinement, build a support network of friends, family, or legal advocates who can assist you in the event of solitary confinement.

**Tip**: Write letters to family and friends in advance or create a list of people to contact in case you are isolated. Even knowing you have a support network can provide emotional relief.

![](social.png)

#### Prepare for Long-Term Coping:

Understand that recovery can take [time](https://www.mentalhealth.com/library/stages-of-mental-health-recovery): After solitary confinement, many people face long-term psychological effects. Being mentally prepared for the process of recovery can help you manage expectations and give yourself grace.

Post-release planning: If you are released after a period of solitary confinement, it's important to have plans for reintegration into society, which can include therapy, support groups, and other mental health resources.

**Tip**: Begin to think about life after confinement, even if it's a distant possibility. Establish goals and connections to help with reintegration when the time comes.

![](recovery.png)

As mentioned earlier, recovery is a lengthy process. Here is a [testimony](https://www.aclu.org/news/prisoners-rights/i-spent-16-months-solitary-confinement-and-now-im) from someone who spent 16 months in solitary confinement. If it happens to you, don't hesitate to seek help from specialists who can assist you, join dedicated support groups, or even share your feelings and thoughts with others. Social interaction and sharing are some of the most effective ways to heal and recover.

## What are the alternatives to solitary confinement? 

There are several alternatives to solitary confinement that focus on rehabilitation, mental health, and restorative justice. These alternatives are being explored and implemented by countries and institutions as part of "efforts" to reduce the negative psychological and physical impacts of isolation. Here are some of the key alternatives:

#### Restorative Justice Programs

The objective is to repair harm and reintegrate offenders into the community.

[Restorative](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17488958231215228) justice emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment. It involves face-to-face meetings between victims and offenders (with supervision) where the offender takes responsibility for their actions and works to repair the harm done. This process aims to foster accountability, promote healing, and reintegrate individuals into society. The expected benefits are the following: 

- Promotes empathy and accountability.

- Reduces recidivism by addressing the root causes of criminal behavior.

- Facilitates emotional healing for both victims and offenders.

The Norwegian prison system often employs restorative justice models where inmates are encouraged to participate in restorative circles.

![](restorative.png)

#### Therapeutic Communities

The objective is to give peer support and professional therapy within a community environment.

Therapeutic communities [(TCs)](https://holistichealthpathways.com/glossario/what-is-therapeutic-communities-comprehensive-guide/) are structured living environments where individuals work together to address their issues, such as addiction, mental health challenges, or behavioral problems. These communities focus on peer support and professional counseling, allowing individuals to engage in therapy while interacting with others, which is a healthier alternative to isolation. The expected benefits are the following: 

- Builds social and emotional skills.

- Offers treatment for mental health or addiction issues.

- Promotes accountability and responsibility within a community context.

The United Kingdom has adopted therapeutic community models in some of its prisons, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.

![](community.png)

### Behavioral Management Programs

The objective is to address problematic behavior with structured interventions.

Rather than resorting to solitary confinement for behavioral issues, prisons can use structured behavioral management [programs](https://www.ourmental.health/impulsivity/3-groundbreaking-impulsivity-management-programs-in-prisons) that involve counseling, group therapy, and structured schedules. These programs focus on addressing specific behavioral problems (e.g., aggression, substance abuse) in a supportive environment. The expected benefits are the following: 

- Tackles root causes of disruptive behavior.

- Encourages positive behavioral change without isolation.

- Allows inmates to stay engaged with the general population.

The Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) programs used in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, and Australia, aim to modify negative thinking and behaviors.

![](behaviour.png)

Even though these techniques are far better than solitary confinement, they're still part of the problem for me. Most of the alternatives are designed to make people change and behave according to what the state wants. In other words, instead of torturing people, the state is trying to reprogram them. It's still a control tool used by governments to manipulate the population. I don't want to get too philosophical here, but isn't forcing someone to become someone they're a form of torture?

## Conclusion 

As you've seen, solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane forms of torture that can be applied to someone. And the other alternatives aren't much better. What makes solitary confinement the worst is that it impacts both the body and the mind simultaneously, turning your own physical and mental state into your worst enemies. And this is something governments are fully aware of, as numerous studies have been published on this subject and presented to them. So why does it continue? Simply put, because governments seek control over the population, no matter the cost. Solitary confinement allows control before, during, and after its use. Before and after, because of the fear it instills in the population, and during, because of everything we've discussed in this article.

Populations are not protesting against it because they aren't fully aware of what's happening. Since it doesn't appear as overt violence, many people fail to recognize how violent it truly is. Most people will never experience solitary confinement in their lives and simply can't grasp what it entails. And that means they aren't prepared for it. But now, you know what's going on.
