# Being forced into violence by gangs

## Introduction

Imagine making [mistakes](../opsecmistakes/index.md) with your operational security while engaging in illegal activities, leading to your imprisonment. What could go wrong? A lot. First and foremost, prisons are often controlled by gangs, and survival can mean being forced into violence. Are you prepared for that? In this blog post, we will explore what could happen if you find yourself in this situation and how you can prepare for it.

## What "Gang" means? 

Gangs can be defined as follows:

"*A gang is a group or society of associates, friends, or family members with a defined leadership and internal organization. This group identifies with or claims control over a specific territory within a community and engages, either individually or collectively, in illegal and possibly [violent](https://www.criminaljusticedegreehub.com/most-dangerous-prison-gangs/) behavior, which often constitutes a form of organized crime.*"

While this definition is accurate, it is incomplete. One crucial aspect that should be added is that gangs are also groups of criminals or individuals who come together for mutual protection and profit.

This idea of mutual protection and profit is especially significant in a prison environment. In jail, ensuring your own protection can quickly become your primary concern, as violence is rampant and often encouraged by the authorities. In fact, many governments view violence in prisons as a form of "cleaning", seeing each inmate death as one less they have to deal with themselves. Additionally, the state uses these violent conditions as a tool to deter the public from engaging in criminal behavior, portraying imprisonment as a deterrent. Fear, in this sense, becomes a powerful tool for manipulating public opinion.

The key point to understand is that gangs operate both inside and outside of prisons, and their activities within the prison system can have significant repercussions on the outside world, and vice versa. This means that what happens to you while incarcerated can directly affect your life beyond the prison walls.

## What gangs can ask you to do (And how to protect yourself)? 

Several factors can influence a gang's decision to ask something of you in prison. However, the reward they offer remains consistent: [protection](https://www.mylawquestions.com/what-is-a-protection-racket.htm). This protection can be from other gangs, individuals, or even protection from their own group. If you refuse to obey them, they will allow you to be harmed or even killed by others. Typically, they will begin by severely beating you to try to make you comply, without going as far as killing you, since they still expect something from you. If you continue to resist, the situation will escalate, and the consequences can become life-threatening.

The first and most basic demand gangs will make of you is to engage in violence. They want you to be violent on their behalf, often targeting [members](https://www.colorado.edu/asmagazine/2020/04/03/we-spoke-hundreds-prison-gang-members-heres-what-they-said-about-life-behind-bars) of rival gangs, as a way to prove your loyalty. The problem is that, in most cases, you have no real choice. If you refuse to comply, you'll face punishment. If you obey, you're forced into a dangerous situation where you could either be killed or become an enemy of another gang. Either way, you're caught in a no-win scenario, where your survival depends on your ability to navigate these violent demands.

![](violence.png)

The second demand gangs may make is to have you [procure](https://www.inmateaid.com/information/smuggling-behind-bars-how-contraband-enters-prisons-and-its-impact) or produce specific items for them, often from outside of the prison. This could include drugs, cell phones, weapons, or anything else they need. While this may seem less immediately dangerous than engaging in violence, it still carries significant risks. Not only does it place your own legal responsibility at stake, but it could also implicate others in your life. If you're caught, you'll be the sole one held accountable, facing legal consequences for the gang's illicit activities.

Gangs can also demand [money](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2025/jan/15/georgia-prisoner-accused-running-35-million-protection-racket/) from you, which may seem like the least dangerous option at first. However, this approach rarely ends well. Once you start paying, they will continue to ask for more, even after you're released from prison. These demands can put you and your loved ones at risk, as they may become targets if you're unable to meet the gang's growing expectations. Over time, if you fail to comply or try to cut ties, violence will likely resurface as the gang seeks to enforce their control.

![](myth.png)

Additionally, gangs may try to recruit you as a specialist if they learn that your criminal background could be useful to them. For example, if you're in prison for creating fake IDs or running illegal financial operations, they may force you to use your skills to benefit the gang. In such cases, they will likely demand that you continue these activities on their behalf, either inside the prison or once you're released. The pressure to comply with their demands can be immense, and resistance often leads to violent consequences.

![](organization.png)

So, what can you do to protect yourself? The reality is that, in many cases, avoiding involvement with prison gangs might not be possible. It's essential to prepare yourself before heading to prison. The most practical approach is to learn how to fight efficiently and defend yourself. Since violence is an unavoidable part of prison life, becoming accustomed to it is crucial. However, keep in mind that you might face unequal situations, like being outnumbered in fights (3 vs 1 or even 5 vs 1), where your life could be at risk. The goal here is to maximize your chances of survival, but it's important to understand that even the best preparation doesn't guarantee safety. There is such violence in prison that a [martial](https://www.martialtribes.com/52-blocks-prison-fight/) art was created in it. 

![](fight.png)

Another crucial point to remember is that operational security (OPSEC) doesn't stop when you enter prison. It's vital to avoid sharing personal information about your life outside of prison, as doing so makes it easier for gangs to manipulate or control you through your relatives. If you're fortunate enough to avoid corrupt correctional [officers](https://www.inmateaid.com/information/when-prison-guards-become-the-criminals-inside-corruption-behind-bars) who might sell your information, you could limit the impact of your prison experience on your personal life. However, even with caution, it's never a 100% guarantee, just one piece of information can be enough to unravel everything. Stay vigilant, as the stakes are high.As mentioned earlier, it's important not to reveal the reason for your imprisonment. Appearing useful to a gang can quickly make you a target for recruitment or coercion. The less others know about your background, especially skills that could benefit criminal activity, the safer you may be. Maintaining discretion is a key part of protecting yourself in that environment.

## What gangs are ruling prisons ? 

Across the globe, many gangs exert control over prison systems.

![](triad.png)

As you can see, the most influential prison gangs have a widespread presence across the globe. This means that if you end up in prison, you'll likely have to contend with them. Even in countries where gangs aren't as dominant in society, smaller gangs still often control prison environments, exerting influence over daily life and the prison hierarchy.

One of the main factors influencing gang membership in prison is race. As noted, many gangs accept only members of a specific racial background. This is a critical piece of information, as it helps you quickly identify which groups may view you as an outsider or potential enemy, and which ones may try to force you into cooperation. Understanding this dynamic is essential for assessing your position within the prison hierarchy and anticipating potential threats or pressures.

## Conclusion

As you've seen, there are many gangs in prison ready to force you into violence. And the reality is, violence is almost guaranteed 99% of the time. You must be prepared to fight and stay vigilant, but just as importantly, you need to maintain strong OPSEC while incarcerated. Survival odds are much lower in prison than on the outside, and keeping your personal information secure becomes far more challenging. This is why anyone involved in illegal activities must be fully prepared for the possibility of prison, understanding both the physical and mental demands of navigating that environment.
