# Being lured into meeting someone IRL

```
TLDR: you're much more likely to deanonymize yourself IRL than online, if you want to remain anonymous, don't ever meet your anonymous friends online, because those are most likely feds.
```

## Introduction

Sometimes, when you're anonymously part of online communities, you make real friends. I mean, genuine connections. Even if you don't know their real identity or what they look like, some people can become close to you simply by the way they interact and how they make you feel. That's completely normal, and many lasting friendships have been formed online. However, you may also feel the urge to meet these people in real life (IRL) to take the friendship further. This can be a risky move, and in some cases, it might be a huge mistake. In this blog post, we'll explore the potential consequences of meeting someone IRL after forming an online bond.

## Splitting anonymous online life and IRL interactions

Here, I'd like to emphasize the importance of keeping your anonymous online life separate from your real-life interactions. You might wonder why this is so critical, and it's great that you're asking the question. The main objective of [OPSEC](../opsec/index.md) (operations security) is to ensure your security, securing your environment, your identity, your actions, and more. This means you don't want anyone to connect your online activities to your real-world identity. However, when you interact with people IRL, you are exposing yourself in ways that could compromise that anonymity.

*CCTV cameras can be used for facial recognition to identify and track you when you are outside* 

Let's take a quick example to make it clearer:

Imagine you're a hacker, earning money by stealing data from individuals or organizations with poor OPSEC (They did not follow our tutorials!). Would you want anyone to know that you're a hacker, or worse, know who you are in real life? Probably not.

I'm using an extreme example here because it helps illustrate the point more clearly. But even if you're not a hacker, it's important to understand that, in a world where states are increasingly [criminalizing](../everyoneisacriminal/index.md) freedom, you don't want anyone to know what you're doing online. The less people know about your digital activities, the safer you are.

![](rat.png)

Moreover, it's also crucial to protect yourself from anyone who might try to uncover your identity or location in order to exploit you. While a solid OPSEC strategy can protect you from online attacks, it doesn't eliminate the risk of physical [threats](https://cointelegraph.com/news/violent-crypto-robberies-rise-six-attacks-investors). If your digital security is solid and there's no way to attack you through the internet, some individuals might attempt to do so in the physical world.

For example, if you are publicly known for your involvement with [Monero](../monerofirst/index.md), there's a risk that someone could track you down and threaten you to gain access to your wallet. In this scenario, being physically vulnerable or identifiable could put you in danger. That's why maintaining strict privacy is not only important online but in real life as well. Protecting your identity across all aspects of your life is vital for ensuring your overall safety and security.

## IRL Meetings are the feds playground 

![](playground.png)

If your OPSEC is solid and makes you untraceable online, an in-person meeting could be the easiest way for authorities to catch you. Yes, law enforcement agencies are actively monitoring the internet, seeking to identify individuals who are simply trying to operate freely online. As mentioned earlier, many activities are deemed illegal by governments, and they are often willing to target anyone who defies their [abusive](../abusivelaws/index.md) laws.

You may think there's no reason for authorities to target you. However over the years we've seen cases where people were law enforcement spied not only on the suspect but also on their relatives and friends. Let me give you an example: 

![](disarray.png)

Imagine you're part of a specific community, like a [SimpleX](../privatesimplex/index.md) chat dedicated to your favorite video game. Over time, you become good friends with another user, someone who shares similar views and interests. But what you don't know is that this user is under federal [surveillance](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-authorities-infiltrate-the-internet-underworld/) because they're also involved in another group engaged in activities deemed illegal. The authorities could start by [befriending](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-feds-go-undercover/) you, slowly building trust over months or even years. Eventually, they might suggest an in-person meeting, hoping to manipulate the situation and pressure you into becoming an [informant](../becominganinformant/index.md). At this point, they could find any reason to coerce you into cooperating, using the threat of legal action, because in their eyes, anyone can be considered a [criminal](../everyoneisacriminal/index.md).

### How they operate 

Here's how the feds typically operate:

1) **Targeting a Community**: They become aware of a specific online community involved in activities deemed "illegal" by their standards.

2) **Infiltration**: Agents infiltrate the community, often starting as a regular user. They are permitted to engage in illegal actions if it helps them build trust within the group.

![](communityorg.png)

*I intentionally simplified the example by using a small community, as the purpose of this diagram is only to introduce what will follow.*

3) **Identifying Key Targets**: They identify individuals within the community who seem like valuable targets for their investigation.

4) **Gathering Information**: They work on collecting as much information as possible about the members of the community, both online and offline.

![](interactionsmap.png)

*The thicker the line, the more interactions it represents. Congratulations, you are now considered a pathway to the community leader.*

5) **Finding Leverage**: They look for members who can be manipulated into providing access to their targets, whether through personal relationships or other means.

6) **Investigating Vulnerabilities**: They investigate these individuals further, searching for anything they can use against them, like past legal issues or sensitive information.

7) **Organizing In-Person Meetings**: The authorities will arrange real-life (IRL) meetings with potential informants, building rapport to set the stage for collaboration.

![](meeting.png)

*No matter how strong your OPSEC is, meeting someone face-to-face gives you a significant risk of compromising it.*

8) **Coercing Cooperation**: Using tactics like false accusations, threats, or manipulation, they push the individual to cooperate, often under duress or fear of legal consequences.

9) **Gathering Intel on the Target**: Once cooperation is secured, they leverage the informant to gather more information about their intended target.

10) **Tracking the Target**: Using the acquired data, they can track and monitor the target's activities, potentially leading to arrests or further infiltration.

In this process, you're just a tool. By agreeing to meet with them in real life, you inadvertently opened the door to becoming an informant. Now, even if you didn't want to, your involvement could be used against you, and you may be seen as an ongoing source of information for years to come.

### Why are they doing that ? 

At the end of the day, it's a matter of cost vs. benefits. Deploying extensive technology and highly skilled personnel to track someone with perfect OPSEC online is costly, with minimal results. On the other hand, using more traditional methods, like infiltration and coercion, is far cheaper and yields much higher returns. 

This is exactly how the feds [infiltrated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Pistone) the mafia for decades. By becoming part of the organization, gathering information about its members, and then coercing individuals to cooperate, they were able to take down their targets. It's a straightforward strategy.

![](brasco.png)

Additionally, informants play a crucial role in these operations. They're essentially low-cost resources for the feds, who can use them whenever necessary. Informants speed up investigations and help authorities build stronger cases.

![](informants.png)
*Here is a screenshot directly taken from the FBI website.*

Manipulating people to obtain something is far easier than conducting a thorough investigation using well-executed OPSEC. Moreover, it increases the control that governments have over individuals, which is often one of their ultimate goals. Sometimes, informants are [paid](https://legalclarity.org/how-much-do-confidential-informants-get-paid/), creating a financial dependency on the feds that makes them more willing to cooperate. This tactic can also be effective in drug-related cases as they do not hesitate to use drugs to reward informants.

### The impossibility of anonymous IRL meetings 

Having anonymous IRL interactions is nearly impossible, and for a simple reason: the goal of OPSEC is to be able to act freely, privately, and anonymously within an environment you can fully control. However, when you step outside of that controlled environment, you lose the ability to fully master it.

Governments, for example, have deployed a range of [surveillance](https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/five-things-to-know-about-nsa-mass-surveillance-and-the-coming-fight-in-congress) techniques in public spaces, including agents, cameras, informants, facial recognition, and other tracking methods, all of which can identify and monitor you beyond your personal space.

![](surveillance.png)

You might be tempted to cover your face in an attempt to avoid recognition, but here's the catch: in some states, doing so is considered [illegal](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/anti-mask-laws-by-state), and you could be arrested for trying it.

There's another issue you can't control that could impact your anonymity more than you think: accidental loss of anonymity. Imagine you've successfully avoided facial recognition and kept your identity hidden from the person you're meeting, only for a friend or family member to spot you and come over while you're with your online contact. Just like that, your anonymity is compromised.

One last thing to consider is that, even if you've managed to stay anonymous during the meeting, you could still be [followed](https://www.phenixinvestigations.com/intelligence-blog/can-you-tell-if-a-private-investigator-is-following-you-signs-to-look-for) on your way back home, inadvertently revealing your location to anyone who might be tracking you. And trust me, you don't want that. Your home is the foundation of your OPSEC, and revealing it could completely undermine everything you've worked to protect.

## How to minimize the risks if you decide to do it even if it is a bad idea 

Alright, now we're venturing into a realm of hopes and dreams that can be dashed quickly. I'll share some tips that could help you maintain anonymity while meeting someone in real life, but you need to keep in mind that this is really theoretical. Meeting someone in person while maintaining true anonymity is still a very risky idea, and it's generally not advisable.

**Use Pseudonyms and Fake Identities**: When meeting someone, never use your real name or any identifying details. Create a separate [identity](../multiple_identities/index.md) that isn't linked to your online persona or your IRL identity.

**Use Disposable Communication Methods**: Avoid giving out your personal phone number or email. Consider using burner phones and stick to [SimpleX](../anonsimplex/index.md).

**Choose Public, Low-Traffic Locations**: Meeting in places where there's less surveillance can help mask your identity. Avoid well known areas where you could be more easily tracked or recognized. And, go as far as you can go from your location. 

![](nowhere.png)
*This one is a little exaggerated, but you get the idea.*

**Control Your Personal Appearance:** Wear [neutral](https://weheartthis.com/neutral-clothing-colors/) clothing that doesn't stand out. Avoid anything that could give away your identity or make you memorable. You might even want to use a hat, sunglasses, or a mask, though be mindful of the legalities.

**No Photos or Videos**: Don't take any pictures or let the other person take photos of you. You don't want anything online that could link back to your real identity.

**Keep Your Path Unpredictable**: Don't follow the same route home or back to your destination. Use different [means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_transport) of transportation if possible. This makes it harder for anyone to track you after the meeting. If you need to pay for anything, pay in cash and never use any transportation method that requires your identity like a plane or a train. 

![](road.png)

**Don't Give Out Personal Information**: Keep conversations focused only on the topic you're meeting for. Avoid any talk that could [reveal](https://www.ocstrategic.com/post/the-power-of-elicitation-how-to-gather-crucial-information-without-asking-direct-questions) your personal history, location, or other details that could be traced back to you.

**Have a Contingency Plan**: If you start feeling uncomfortable, or if things don't go as planned, have a way out. Always plan your escape route in case you need to leave quickly. If you can, wear a weapon. 

![](escape.png)

> Even if you follow all this advice, there's still a high chance you could lose your anonymity. Once again, IRL meetings are not a good idea.

## Examples of people who get busted because of IRL meetings

To illustrate what could happen if you meet someone in real life whom you met anonymously online, I'd like to share the following examples.

### The Hacker - Chelsea Manning (2010)

Chelsea [Manning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Manning), an Army intelligence analyst, leaked a massive amount of classified government information. Manning was able to initially operate anonymously online while engaging in communications through untraceable means.

Manning began chatting online with Adrian [Lamo](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/hacker-adrian-lamo-who-reported-chelsea-manning-dies-at-37/), a former hacker who had previously been active in various online communities. At one point, Manning met Lamo IRL in a café in Baltimore. This meeting led to Lamo suspecting Manning's involvement in the leaks.

Lamo reported Manning to the authorities. Manning was arrested in May 2010 and later sentenced to 35 years in prison. 

While Manning operated under anonymous conditions online, meeting someone IRL, especially someone with motives or connections to law enforcement, led to the breach of anonymity and serious legal consequences.

![](lamo.png)

### The Hacking Group - The "LulzSec" Group (2011)

LulzSec, a notorious hacker group, carried out high-profile cyberattacks on major organizations like Sony and the CIA. Most of their operations were done under complete anonymity through the use of pseudonyms and encryption.

Hector [Monsegur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector_Monsegur) (known as “Sabu”), a key member of LulzSec, was arrested in 2011. Monsegur had developed a close relationship with fellow hacker Jeremy [Hammond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hammond). The two met IRL and communicated about hacking operations and plans. After Monsegur was arrested, he turned informant, leading to Hammond's capture.

Hammond was arrested in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years in prison for his involvement in the [attacks](https://www.dailydot.com/news/hammond-sabu-fbi-stratfor-hack/) carried out by the group.

Even in hacking circles where anonymity is crucial, meeting people IRL can lead to being caught, especially if one individual turns informant. It highlights how even casual encounters can lead to irreversible consequences.

![](hammond.png)

### The Cryptocurrency Scammers - "OneCoin" Scandal (2015-2017)

Ruja Ignatova, the founder of the cryptocurrency scam [OneCoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/article/the-onecoin-scam-the-dazzling-story-of-the-biggest-crypto-ponzi-in-history), was able to maintain anonymity for years. OneCoin was marketed as a revolutionary digital currency but turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, stealing billions from investors.

Ignatova and her associates met people IRL at private events to recruit them into their scam. Eventually, one of her associates, Mark Scott, was caught after trying to launder the stolen funds. He had been in contact with others who provided information about the organization's operations, leading to significant legal consequences.

Ignatova went into [hiding](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/18/us/cryptoqueen-ruja-ignatova-partner-sentenced-cec) and is still on the FBI's wanted list for her involvement in the scam. Mark Scott was arrested and sentenced to prison for money laundering.

While online anonymity is essential, real-world interactions with criminal associates can provide law enforcement with the key evidence needed to break anonymity and bring criminals to justice.

![](onecoin.png)

## What next ? 

Now that you've been compromised and your online persona is no longer anonymous, what can you do? Unfortunately, there is only one solution: start over. Delete everything tied to your persona, create a new one, and begin again. Even if you've built strong relationships or been involved in fantastic projects, you must disappear.

If you've followed the advice in this [article](../multiple_identities/index.md), you should have separate identities for different activities, meaning only one of them is compromised. That's a good thing, you won't have to start from scratch with everything. However, if you didn't separate your identities and were running everything under a single one, well... unfortunately, you might have to start over from the [beginning](../opsecoverego/index.md).

![](../internetsegmentation/6.png)

In addition to starting over, it's crucial to stay away from any activities considered "illegal" for a while. Be patient, keep a low profile, and avoid drawing attention to yourself. If you're involved in such activities under your other identities, you must ensure that, if law enforcement or authorities come knocking on your door, they won't find anything that could tie you to those activities. Even if they are investigating something unrelated, they will charge you for whatever they uncover during their search. So, it's essential to keep everything as clean as possible and minimize risk.

## Conclusion 

As you've seen throughout this blog post, IRL meetings with people you've met anonymously online are not a good idea. There are just too many things that can go wrong, and the risks are not worth it. My final piece of advice is simple: Don't do it. If you choose to meet someone in real life, you are essentially breaking your anonymity.

This is exactly why maintaining different identities for different activities is essential and should be a basic part of your OPSEC strategy. By keeping things separate, you minimize the risks and protect yourself from unwanted exposure.
