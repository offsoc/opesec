# The Nowhere Community and our services

Yes, [Nowhere](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/index.html) is an entire community that stands behind The Opsec Bible project, and we're providing a whole host of services:

## The Nowhere Community


![alt text](image-14.png)

We are individuals here to preserve human rights and individual freedom. The Opsec Bible is currently our crown jewel: a complete knowledge base made to teach everyone how to remain ungovernable in this dystopian era we're currently living in.

In case if you believe in our current fight, consider donating to the project as it is currently costing us an average of 7 XMR on a yearly basis. (**if you donate at least 1 XMR we'll make you a VIP user**, giving you direct access to our Maintainers chatroom, where you can see how we organize the project behind the scenes, just send us the transaction id (TXID) to confirm your identity before we invite you in there via simplex.)

## The Nowhere Services

Our main services include first and foremost The Opsec Bible, which is our main service, as our main goal is in explaining everything that there is to be known about operational security, to ensure individuals can remain ungovernable:

Next we have [Git Datura](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible) (our forgejo instance), which is where we organize and maintain the opsec bible and our other projects behind the scenes:

Git Datura really is the beating heart behind the Opsec Bible and the Nowhere projects, especially due to how critical it is to host the codebase, keep track of the issues, who's assigned on each issue, who's reviewing each one, and which issues are still awaiting payments.

Our next most important service that we're running is the official, main instance of [Darknet Lantern](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php), where we aim to solve the visibility and discoverability problem of the darknet at large, essentially organizing the exploratory work of the darknet at large, to make it as efficient as possible:

Then, to ensure the communication aspect of our community remains intact, we are currently managing a few public [SimpleX chatrooms](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/simplex.html): 

![alt text](image-4.png)

This is mostly where we communicate with our audience, debate on ideas, criticize our existing blogposts, and coordinate in order to properly organize who gets to do what changes on the opsec bible. **Definitely come check out our chatrooms if you're interested in joining our vibrant and growing freedom-loving community !**

To ensure that a professional, adult, and collaborative environment is preserved within our chatrooms, we have moderators that are there to ensure that our [community code of conduct](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/rules.html) (which i believe to be minimal enough) is being respected:

![alt text](image-11.png)

We are also running a set of [onion-only SMP and XFTP simplex servers](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/simplex-servers.html), to further help decentralize the communication ecosystem that Simplex has setup for the public.

![alt text](image-6.png)

Those are all valid simplex servers that you can use to chat anonymously online with, from your simplex client, as long as your [simplex client is connecting through Tor](../anonsimplex/index.md):

And lastly we also have a collection of ebooks that we are making available for our community for free as part of our [Nowhere Library](http://libraryhmny4k3t424tznkzs3776hkn3tw5wijt2bqjvavpwh4544mqd.onion) service:

![alt text](image-7.png)

The library can be browsed thanks to it's minimalistic nginx autoindex, and every pdf file therein can be viewed from the Tor browser directly:

And our last main service is the [Lain Radio](http://6z6g6lv4v7xhupvtjvo4jockd4af5dn47nrxcexu475tbhiflx6ln6ad.onion/), where we broadcast music and ambient tracks that I personally handpicked, to try and help whoever's listening to focus on their work even better.

![alt text](image-20.png)

The web radio software that is being used for this service was forked from the now-defunct Lainchan Radio called [lainon.life](https://lainon.life), which was developed by [Barrucadu](https://github.com/barrucadu/lainonlife).

## The Secondary Nowhere Services

As secondary services that [Oxeo](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/oxeo0.html) is generously running from his servers, we have [4get](http://4getoxeomuwsxbmilpisgi6sgay5y5wcguy4obwoqe7vfk73n4c3mbid.onion/), which is a proxy search engine that can be used to get search results from other search engines like duckduckgo:

![alt text](image.png)

We have an [invidious instance](http://invxoxeo2cflturo6t5qag5a5smmcl2yjszmk64gzzwzqjcu2mw42cyd.onion/) which can be used to view youtube videos without all of their analytics:

![alt text](image-15.png)

We also have a [redlib instance](http://reddoxeo33f7hax73r6h3r3cphwi644aoqvhd3skhru4bocnwfptnxyd.onion/), which you can use to browse reddit without all of their analytics aswell:

![alt text](image-16.png)

We have a [gothub instance](http://gothoxeo4g2yqa3ba27z3sigeprlwan3deogkejooe7zqccou6qgkvad.onion/explore), which can be used  as a proxy service to browse github:

![alt text](image-17.png)

We also have a [privatebin instance](http://binxoxeo2ozhs47it7ymvsyhzy6fannks66hddpo2xyuvhxact5fqtid.onion/), which you can use as a pastebin service to send large text outputs to other people by simply giving them a quick link to access it:

![alt text](image-18.png)

And lastly as a side project currently on the backburner, we have taken part in the [lainchan webring](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/webring.html), don't hesitate to check it out to learn about those other communities that have also taken part in it like us:

![alt text](image-19.png)

And that's it! now you have a complete overview of the Nowhere Community and it's services, we're looking forward to seeing you hang out in our [simplex chatrooms](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/simplex.html) in particular :)
