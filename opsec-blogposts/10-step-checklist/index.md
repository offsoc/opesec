# 10 things you must do if you are pro-freedom

In this quick tutorial we're going to cover 10 steps you must do to ensure you're doing your part in upholding Privacy and Anonymity Online. 

```
TLDR: Your 10-Step Pro-Freedom Checklist:
1) Buy and Sell Goods and Services for Monero (Participate in the Monero Circular Economy)
2) Buy and sell Monero for Fiat on P2P, decentralised and anonymous exchanges (Haveno DEX)
3) Running remote Tor Nodes
4) Running your own Monero node (and make it accessible via Tor!)
5) Mining XMR on p2pool using Gupax
6) Running onion-only SimpleX SMP/XFTP servers
7) Running your own onion-only Forgejo Instance for anonymous collaboration
8) Running an instance of The Opsec Bible
9) Running a Darknet Lantern instance and joining the Webring
10) Spread the Word: Individuals are ungovernable
```

Consider this as your todolist if you're not doing all of the below yet. Online Anonymity requires everyone's participation to remain afloat.

## Step 1: Buy and Sell Goods and Services for Monero (Participate in the Monero Circular Economy)

The first thing you can do is [take part in the Monero Circular economy](https://xmrbazaar.com/), by selling goods and services (which need to be [priced in Monero directly!](../priceinxmr/index.md))in exchange for some Monero:

For example, you can write blogposts for us on the opsec bible in exchange of some Monero as explained on this [xmrbazaar listing](https://xmrbazaar.com/listing/UsWA/):

Also don't forget to donate XMR to all the privacy and anonymity-related projects out there:

- [Kicksecure](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Donate)
- [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Donate)
- [Monero](https://ccs.getmonero.org/donate/)
- [Tor](https://donate.torproject.org/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/donations)
- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/donate)

## Step 2: Buy and sell Monero for Fiat on P2P, decentralised and anonymous exchanges (Haveno DEX)

The next thing you can do is provide liquidity by either [buying or selling XMR for fiat directly on Haveno networks](http://opbible7nans45sg33cbyeiwqmlp5fu7lklu6jd6f3mivrjeqadco5yd.onion/opsec/haveno-client-f2f/) (like [retoswap](https://retoswap.com/))

![](../haveno-client-f2f/104.png)

This ensures people can keep entering and leaving the Monero ecosystem without requiring to go through any other shitcoin out there (such as btc, eth, usdt, etc), or without widening their attack surface like how it would be if they were to use [centralised exchanges](../chainalysisattempts/index.md).

![](../chainalysisattempts/2.png)

## Step 3: Running remote Tor Nodes

This is probably the most important thing you can do is [rent a server anonymously](http://opbible7nans45sg33cbyeiwqmlp5fu7lklu6jd6f3mivrjeqadco5yd.onion/opsec/anonymousremoteserver/index.md), and on it you can run [a Tor node](http://opbible7nans45sg33cbyeiwqmlp5fu7lklu6jd6f3mivrjeqadco5yd.onion/opsec/tor/relay/index.md):

![](../tor/relay/5.png)

This basically helps strengthen and decentralize the Tor Network, which is the actual backbone of online anonymity currently, allowing anyone in the world to browse the web anonymously on the IP layer and access .onion hidden services.

## Step 4: Running your own Monero node (and make it accessible via Tor!)

The next-best way to support online anonymity is to [run your own onion Monero node](../monero2024/index.md) on your own self-hosted [homeserver](../homeserver/index.md) (i recommend it so because of the large disk space required to run a Monero node, which would be expensive to rent on VPSes):

![](../chainalysisattempts/1.5.png)

This is because first of all, adversaries out there are pretty pissed off that Monero exists, since it undermines the traditional statist financial system like no other crypto ever did so far, and the fact that despite so many bounties, Monero still is protecting everyone's financial privacy and anonymity.

![alt text](image-5.png)

To run your own Monero node means that you help strengthen the Monero ecosystem, you help decentralize it further, and you make it possible for other people to use your own node while preserving their anonymity on the IP layer.

## Step 5: Mining XMR on p2pool using Gupax

Next step is to mine Monero using [gupax](../gupax/index.md) on the clientside, or [xmrig](../monerop2pool/index.md) on the serverside:

![](../gupax/6.png)

Mining in cryptocurrencies is important because it helps validate transactions. This is a fundamental requirement for a cryptocurrency to remain usable, and to do so, you need [a powerful CPU](https://xmrig.com/benchmark) that can have a lot of hashpower.

![](../monerop2pool/0.png)

This is especially important to ward off the 51% attacks that state-backed adversaries (such as qubic's recent attacks in Q3 2025) try to carry out on the Monero network, it is essential for everyone to mine Monero in P2Pool, to ensure that Monero remains decentralized, on the mining level.

Here's a [Monero Talk discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yabExtlG2Qc) on the qubic 51% attack attempt, with Luke Parker, for more details on why it is important to mine XMR right now.


## Step 6: Running onion-only SimpleX SMP/XFTP servers

To contribute to the anonymous messaging ecosystem, you can run onion-only SimpleX servers, which basically helps decentralize the messaging ecosystem that SimpleX brought to the internet: 

![](../anonsimplex-server/0.png)

Running an onion-only SMP and XFTP server enables people to chat anonymously with anyone else who's also using SimpleX.


You can even create public [SimpleX Chatrooms](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/simplex.html) using those onion-only [SimpleX servers](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/simplex-servers.html):

![alt text](image-6.png)

## Step 7: Running your own onion-only Forgejo Instance for anonymous collaboration

To ensure that people stop using GitHub (and thus refrain from making their projects vulnerable to Microsoft's statist bootlicking), you can run [an onion forgejo instance](../forgejo-anon/index.md):

![](../forgejo-anon/19.png)

This allows for FOSS projects to remain decentralized, to remain impossible to being delisted by Microsoft in GitHub like what happened to tornadocash, all while enabling anonymous-first collaboration on any project you want to develop.

## Step 8: Running an instance of The Opsec Bible

Yes, you can run an instance of the opsec bible as detailed in [this tutorial](../runtheblog/index.md).

![alt text](image-3.png)

This ensures that your community gets to receive the proper message: They can become ungovernable if they choose to be. Simple as that.

## Step 9: Running a Darknet Lantern instance and joining the Webring

And the last step you can do is run your own [Darknet Lantern](../darknetlantern/index.md) to help people find all of your services that you setup just above:

![alt text](image.png)

This enables you to list (for your own community let's say), all of your [onion services](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php?query=.&sensitive=1), all of the onion [Monero nodes](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php?query=Monero%20Nodes&sensitive=1) that you host, all of the [SimpleX SMP/XFTP servers](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php?query=Simplex%20Servers&sensitive=1), and all of your public [SimpleX chatrooms](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php?query=Simplex%20Chatrooms&sensitive=1).

In short, by running a darknet lantern and joining the webring, you take part in a multi-community effort to help the internet at large explore and discover the darknet, exponentially growing your visibility and discoverability the bigger the webring becomes.

## Step 10: Spread the Word: Individuals are Ungovernable

Everyone on the internet deserves to know the raw truth: **they can become ungovernable, and absolutely free if they choose to be**.

The parasitic states around the world don't want anyone to know it, and are willing to manipulate every source of media out there into pushing their propaganda that supposedly they are all-knowing, all-powerful and everywhere.

![alt text](image-4.png)

They are not all knowing because we have privacy and anonymity, they are not all powerful because we have decentralization, they are not everywhere because we have the numbers which are growing day by day the farther the word spreads.

Talk about the opsec bible on podcasts, in news outlets, in your local area, in online communities that are not aware of our project yet, **spread the message everywhere to whoever is not yet aware that the individual cannot be governed.**
