# Why should I price goods and services in Monero directly ?

```
TLDR: because that's how you completely break free from fiat. If everyone does that, fiat would immediately cease to have value.
```

Despite Monero being [the only cryptocurrency that's being used as an actual currency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTTac2XjyFY), it still suffers from not being directly priced in Monero, people's minds have not yet shifted from thinking in fiat, to thinking in Monero, and this comes from 2 reasons:

- Monero's price relative to fiat currencies being volatile
- very few other Goods and Services are being directly priced in XMR, which doesnt give anyone any other comparisons to estimate their price with, unlike with fiat currencies.

## The State wants you to think in fiat

The goal of any government is to make sure that their population keeps thinking in fiat, because that is how they get you to keep believing in the value of their printed money.

If tomorrow everyone only thinks in XMR instead of Fiat, the value of fiat money would collapse very hard and free markets would explode in popularity.

## How do i estimate the price of something? 

For example IRL if you want to purchase an entry-level phone, you don't know how price it in monero because you currently don't know other goods and services priced in monero directly to compare it to and estimate it's price.

However this is not the case when you want to price it in a fiat currency such as in Euros. Because there are plenty of other goods and services priced in euros to compare it to, it's easy to price it in Euros directly.

Therefore right now for euros it's easy to give a price range for an entry-level phone, the price range in euros is roughly from 80 euros to 170 euros.


## Why is pricing goods and services in Monero is essential for the circular economy ?

In short, by pricing goods and services in Monero directly, you are making it easy for other people to price their goods and services in Monero directly. Take for example those [xmrbazaar offers](https://xmrbazaar.com/search/spend-xmr/): 

![alt text](image-1.png)

In red you can see offers priced in fiat (ex: in euros or dollars) and in green you can see some offers that are directly priced in Monero, and those can be used as comparisons to price your own goods and services in monero directly aswell. 

Ideally there should be at least one in every possible category of goods and services that should be priced in monero directly to serve as comparisons for both buyers and sellers.


## Gradually untangling the fiat thinking problem

The current problem is that we are pricing our items in euros, and paying in monero.

No, we should price goods and services in monero directly, and the more people do that, the easier it will be to gauge the value of monero without having to resort to fiat.

![alt text](image.png)

Here in this example you have a chart of the price of monero based on euros, that's how most people price their goods currently, they want to sell an IRL item for a value of 266 euros let's say, so they look up at that chart and they determine that the value of the item is at 1 XMR right now.

**Problem is, why do we need to depend on some potentially corrupt centralised service (such as exchanges) to know the price of Monero ? They can easily manipulate Monero's value under a gag order right ?**

If you want to base the price of monero on it's actual street value relative to fiat, i recommend you look at how much people are buying and selling it for on retoswap (which uses [Haveno](../haveno-client-f2f/index.md) as their backend), which you can inspect either from the haveno app itself:

Or from the [Haveno markets](http://lsj5o4i7iiogz6q4rstiv75nk7kots2f2nhuga75y7s23leskz2uh6id.onion/) website:

The price of Monero should not be determined by fiat currency, as those are currencies that have been corrupted by statists for decades already. This corruption must not seep into the monero ecosystem, to do so we need to uproot and reject fiat from our thinking altogether.

## What are we doing to contribute to the stabilisation of the XMR currency ?

Up until today (28th June 2025) our strategy at Nowhere, has been to pay for contributions priced in euros (as per our listing in [xmrbazaar](https://xmrbazaar.com/listing/UsWA/)), and to issue the payouts in monero, based on it's current value in euros.

![alt text](image-5.png)

As explained above, this is not the correct approach as the pricing of the payouts in XMR is volatile, **We need to stabilize it as much as we possibly can**. So let's edit this listing to price everything in Monero directly instead:

Right now the street value of XMR on [haveno reto](http://lsj5o4i7iiogz6q4rstiv75nk7kots2f2nhuga75y7s23leskz2uh6id.onion/market/EUR) is 262 euros in XMR:

![alt text](image-2.png)

However i recommend picking the moving average instead (which is the line in blue), so right now we'll consider that the **price of monero is 285 at euros** (and i recommend that you try to price rewards slightly higher in XMR to attract people to your products), so to calculate the price in XMR of your products, do the following:

Rewards for opsec bible contributions priced in euros, and paid in XMR:

- Simple (5 to 20eur) 
- Doable (20 to 30eur) 
- Complex (30 to 50eur) 

For example to convert the price of 50 euros to the price of XMR, do the following calculation: 50 (euros) times 1 (xmr) divided by 285 (price of 1 xmr in euros) which equates to 0.175 XMR, which gives us the following prices:

Rewards for opsec bible contributions price in XMR, and paid in XMR **(prices valid for Q3 2025)**:

- **Simple (0.0175 to 0.0701xmr)**
- **Doable (0.0701 to 0.1052xmr)** 
- **Complex (0.1052 to 0.1754xmr)** 

Take note that you should also write the duration of which you pledge to not move your prices, for instance right now **i'm pledging to not change my reward prices in XMR for 3 entire months, the entire length of Q3 2025**, instead of letting the euro change the XMR price every day. 

This means that if you wanted to work for the next 3 months, and the price of the euro were to crash massively for that period, you could choose to work for me and still get paid appropriately, thanks to the XMR pricing not moving for that period.

From the perspective of the one paying in XMR directly, you may initially fear that you're giving your money away almost for free, **but that's because you are still thinking in euros**, but the more people start to price their goods and services in monero, that fear will subside, as we gradually escape that fiat thinking trap altogether, towards an Agorist market completely free from fiat's influence.

And that's it! see you guys in the Monero Circular Economy, everyone needs to do their part, i intend to make it so that we serve as an example to follow.

PS: shoutout to [Shortwavesurfer2009](https://xmrbazaar.com/user/shortwavesurfer2009) for initially making me aware of how important it is to price goods and services in XMR directly
