# Roadmap Progress (as of Q3 2025)

Welcome to our **quarterly activity recap of the OPSEC Bible Roadmap**: The Opsec Bible covers a wide array of topics and tutorials, but all share the same goal: **empowering the individual, to tell them how to make themselves ungovernable.** Privacy comes first, then anonymity, and lastly deniability.

(yes i changed it from monthly to quarterly, as monthly seemed to be unecessary)

Beyond our Privacy/Anonymity/Deniability classification we have 3 types of tutorials:

- **Clientside Tutorials:** Achieving your opsec goals on your own computer/mobile
- **Serverside (Self-Hosting) Tutorials:** Achieving opsec goals on your home server
- **Serverside (Remote) Tutorials:** Achieving opsec on remote servers (VPSes / Dedicated servers)

Within this classification of tutorials we have a special category of tutorials called the "Core tutorials" which are basically the tutorials that enable everything that is opsec-related that we are talking about. **You can consider those to be the actual backbone of your operational security**.

Our roadmap is based on the following critical tutorials first and foremost, as they are actually making possible every other opsec tutorial that we have.

First of all i want to congratulate and thank all of our excellent contributors who helped get the opsec bible to where it currently is right now, as it's been a really INTENSE last 3 months, as you can see below:

## Clientside tutorials (13 completed out of 21)

The clientside tutorials have had some new tutorials added recently, as we felt that there were some topics that really needed to be covered

- **SimpleX Deniable Chats** [#317](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/317): currently WIP, the tutorial is currently being written by a new contributor
- **NEW: The Dangers of ordering drugs online** [#495](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/495): While i don't want to recommend people to order drugs in the first place, i want us to anyway talk about it to explain all the dangers that it poses, since this is after all a major reason people flock to the darknet in the first place.
- **NEW: The Dangers and limits of Javascript Fingerprinting** [#496](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/496): Such a popular topic on the darknet, and it is also the source of unecessary paranoia and misunderstandings. We're going to clear it all up and explain how exactly javascript affects your attack surface, especially in our vm-based internet use segmentation context.
- **NEW: Bypassing KYC procedures using AI image generation** [#292](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/292): This one has tremendous potential, it will potentially enable everyone to literally outright bypass every KYC procedure out there, to allow themselves to freely use services anonymously, whether the website administrators want it or not.

## Serverside Self-Hosting tutorials (11 completed out of 16)

Good progress in that section since the last 3 months, currently this section is missing the following tutorials:

- **NEW: Automating Emergency Shutdowns (mouse/keyboard activity detection)** [#508](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/508): Probably a very simple solution to a complex problem. Using the mouse and keyboard is everyone's first reflex when checking a computer after all, we'll turn it into a trap for the adversary if they try to touch either of those.
- **Serverside Sensitive VM setup (whonix in a VC hidden volume)** [#327](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/327)
- **Host-OS WAN internet connection failover** [#185](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/185)
- **Automating Emergency Shutdowns (webcam movement detection)** [#328](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/328)
- **Automating Emergency Shutdowns (detecting usb changes)** [#329](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/329)


## Serverside (Remote) Tutorials (13 completed out of 14)

And here we have seen most of the progress since our last roadmap recap, we only have one tutorial left to complete:

- **Multi-Owner Infrastructure Dead Man's Switch (via SimpleX bots)** [#315](http://gdatura24gtdy23lxd7ht3xzx6mi7mdlkabpvuefhrjn4t5jduviw5ad.onion/nihilist/the-opsec-bible/issues/315)

## Nowhere Community News

Since last roadmap recap, [Oxeo0](http://nowherejezfoltodf4jiyl6r56jnzintap5vyjlia7fkirfsnfizflqd.onion/oxeo0.html) has been generously providing privacy front-ends on both Tor and i2p, definitely check those out while they remain available:

It's been a crazy quarter, especially both July and August, and again, i'm infinitely grateful to whoever contributed to the opsec bible so far, and i'm looking forward to completing this project.

## The Future of The Opsec Bible

Once we finish writing all the opsec bible blogposts that i envisionned (even though i bet it won't ever end). At least when we finish all the Core tutorials, the project will enter phase 2:

- **Phase 1: Building: Finish writing all Core tutorials**
- **Phase 2: Benchmarking: Grow our visibility organically + Keep the tutorials updated**

Once everything's written, it's just a matter of keeping all tutorials updated as the tech we recommend may evolve, and the threats may evolve too. That's essentially the benchmarking phase, we'll get to see how our advice holds up as the visibility of the opsec bible grows and gets seen by a bigger audience, which could see threats that we didn't spot yet.

To help us do so, we're also going to focus on making [Darknet Lantern](http://lantern6vrwheap4iahuktz3jtwvovrzhxgwgzvrvp46brdzzekxibqd.onion/index.php) as robust as possible, as it will be a key component to grow our visibility exponentially.
