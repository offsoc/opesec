# Recommended Movies and Series to Watch

Below are some of the movies and series that we recommend you to watch. Those aren't anything serious, it's mostly for entertainment and inspiration, you should see the opsec concepts we talk about actually show up in those:

- **Squid Game** (Concepts of sensitive use, Anonymity and metaphorically criticizes how society works, in all it's dehumanizing cruelty despite looking innocent)
- **Breaking Bad & Better Call Saul** (Portrays the drug world, from manufacturers, to sellers, to law enforcement, to lawyers, to cartels)
- **Mr Robot** (One of the most realistic depictions of the black hat hacking world, an all-out criticism of society)
- **La Casa del Papel** (Interesting thought experiment on how heists can go, all while criticizing capitalism in general)
- **The Matrix Trilogy** (An all-time classic, and philosophical masterpiece)
