# You cannot be governed. You just didn't realize it yet.

Yes, you can become ungovernable if you have proper Operational Security. Everyone can have it. **The Opsec Bible is here to show you why and how you can achieve Operational Security from A to Z.** From Privacy, to Anonymity, to Deniability, on both the Clientside, and the Serverside.

Statism is no longer an option. We are here to show you the Agorist way.

![](opsec4levels/0.png)

[SHOWCASED TUTORIAL:](opsec4levels/index.md) Learn how to audit your own setup, to determine your Operational Security (OPSEC) Level, and find out what is the most appropriate internet use for it.

**BREAKING NEWS:** Welcome to The Opsec Bible v2.0! We are now running mkdocs-material and all of our blogposts have been converted to Markdown to make it simplify the contribution process in the long run.

With this new mkdocs blog version, we have completely changed how you can find blogposts that are relevant to your own situation. Thanks to the Mkdocs search plugin, **you can now search for specific terms (ex:Tor, Monero, Anonymity, Deniability) in the search bar at the top** to find the blogposts that are relevant to what you wish to know. Don't hesitate to combine search terms together to try and find what you need. 

## What is the goal of The Opsec Bible ?

**In short, we're here to tell you why and how you can become ungovernable.**

- **Priority number 1:** Solving the lack of education (no FUD, nor minimization fallacies)
- **Priority number 2:** Opsec advice applicable to 90% of the people out there, to defeat 99% of the risks
- **Priority number 3:** Simplifying the Opsec advice as much as possible to make it as easy to achieve as possible.

## Wall of Fame (as of May 2025)

- [The Kicksecure Documentation](http://www.w5j6stm77zs6652pgsij4awcjeel3eco7kvipheu6mtr623eyyehj4yd.onion/wiki/Documentation) : One of the actual backbones of OPSEC in general, making Privacy, Anonymity and even Deniability possible on the operating system level and explaining how they achieved it 
- [The Whonix Documentation](http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/Documentation) : Another backbone of OPSEC, making Anonymity possible on the guest operating system level and explaining how they achieved it.
- [The Hitchhiker's guide to Anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide/) : The main inspiration for The Opsec Bible, an actual goldmine of information, even though i don't like how everything is in one page.
- [Hackliberty Resources](https://git.hackliberty.org/hackliberty.org/Hack-Liberty-Resources) : Community centered around Anarchism, Agorism, and Cypherpunk in general.
- [Dread /d/opsec](http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/d/opsec) : Dread being one of the largest darknet forums out there, their opsec board is a fertile ground for truth seeking 
- [Sam bent's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Sam_Bent) : Ex-darknet vendor, well versed in anything opsec-related, with solid background on the law in general.
- [Monero Talk's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MoneroTalk) : Show focusing on growing the adoption of Monero to the masses.
- [/biz/'s Monero Info Dump](https://moneroinfodump.neocities.org/) : Website explaining why monero is the ultimate cryptocurrency

## Wall of Shame (as of June 2025)

- [Dread /d/opsec](http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/d/opsec) : Dread being one of the largest darknet forums out there, their opsec board is also (sadly) a fertile ground for disinformation campaigns and dishonest debates, so make sure you double check and challenge everything they claim in there. Forums are anyway not ideal to actually take you from A to Z when it comes to exploring entire fields of study like operational security. [EDIT: the mods stopped caring apparently.](dreadopsec/index.md)
- [PrivacyGuides](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/mobile-browsers/?h=mobile+browsers#legacy-adblock-settings) : Sadly a far too popular community of privacy laxists, [claiming that using closed-source software is supposedly suitable for private use](https://discuss.privacyguides.net/t/should-privacy-guides-require-open-source-source-first-or-source-available-as-a-criteria-for-all-tools/22684/83).
- [Techlore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA4KyQBdSu8) : Another privacy laxist community claiming that privacy is possible on Windows, or MacOS.
- [PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/windows) : Yet another privacy laxism community, claiming that privacy is possible on Windows
