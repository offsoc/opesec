# Where are VPNs, Tor, Monero and SimpleX Legal ?

## Introduction

Some tools are extremely useful, if not essential, when it comes to maintaining [anonymity](../aps/index.md) online. In this blog, we provide tutorials for many of them to help you improve your OPSEC and stay anonymous. However, as you may know, governments do not support the idea of people being free to act as they wish online, as they prefer to maintain control over the population. That's why we will explore where some of these tools are legal or not, and how to adapt accordingly.

> Before continuing, keep in mind that all the information provided in this blog post is accurate as of today. However, laws can change frequently, and these changes may affect the legality or use of certain tools in the future.

## VPNs 

When it comes to privacy and anonymity, [VPNs](../vpn/index.md) are an essential tool. They allow you to hide your location while browsing online. There are many solutions available on the market, but while some are highly effective, others are closer to [scams](https://web.archive.org/web/20250615121814/https://www.allthingssecured.com/vpn/how-to-spot-fake-vpns/) than legitimate VPN services. To maintain control over their populations, some governments have chosen to ban the use of VPNs, which is a direct attack on people's liberties and should not be tolerated by anyone.

![](mullvad.png)

To explain how governments are blocking VPN usage, here's what is outlined on this [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20250721132426/https://protonvpn.com/blog/are-vpns-illegal/):

"*When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is protected because it is encrypted and routed through the VPN server, hiding your IP address. Governments can block this traffic by restricting the ports used by certain VPN protocols, such as PPTP or L2TP, or even by blocking the IP addresses of VPN services altogether.*

*More advanced tools, like deep packet inspection, can identify VPN protocols in packet metadata. This allows countries such as China to block VPN servers in a more automated and targeted manner. Some countries, like North Korea, have taken more extreme measures by blocking access to all overseas IP addresses.*"

Some countries have very strict laws regarding VPN usage, making it illegal. Others may not explicitly state that VPNs are illegal but still block them through various technical measures. A third category consists of countries where VPN usage isn't officially prohibited, but using them remains risky for the population, as individuals may face government retaliation or surveillance.

Here is a map showing countries where VPNs are illegal, blocked or where it remains uncertain (But dangerous): 

![](vpns.png)

> In Russia, VPN usage is pretty common. Anyway, government [bans](https://web.archive.org/web/20250709094050/https://www.cloudwards.net/russian-vpn-ban/) some of them when he allows the others. That's highly due to the control level they can operate on each one. 

The common factor among the countries displayed on this map is their desire to maintain control over their populations. The key difference between these countries and others that allow VPNs is that these governments are openly pursuing control, while in other places, it's done more covertly. However, don't be fooled, it's just a different approach to achieving the same goal: population control.

If you're in a highly censored or controlled country, there are still ways to access Tor and other privacy tools. [Solutions](../v2ray/index.md) do exist. 

### Real life example

In 2019, an Omani man was sentenced to two years in prison for using a VPN to access restricted content. The individual was accused of using the VPN to circumvent government-imposed restrictions on internet access, which is illegal under Oman's strict cybercrime laws. The man was charged under the country's Cybercrime Law, which criminalizes the use of VPNs to access banned content or services. This case was significant because it highlighted the growing crackdown on VPNs in countries like Oman, where the government seeks to maintain control over internet access and restrict freedom of information.

## Tor

Some countries, similar to their approach with VPNs, are restricting [Tor](https://web.archive.org/web/20250614142003/https://forum.torproject.org/t/tor-project-re-are-there-countries-where-using-tor-is-illegal/18862) usage for their populations. This is primarily driven by their desire to maintain control over people and their fear of losing it. In some of these countries, using Tor is considered a cybercrime when, in reality, it should be regarded as an expression of [freedom](https://web.archive.org/web/20250402203817/https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2024/key-internet-controls).

As I did with the VPN section, I'll share a map showing where [Tor](../torthroughvpn/index.md) is illegal, blocked, or where its status remains uncertain in some countries.

![](Tor.png)

> I'd like to warn you about something. Defining where Tor is illegal, blocked, or uncertain can be tricky, and some countries might get overlooked. For example, the following [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20250614142339/https://privacysavvy.com/security/safe-browsing/is-tor-legal/) lists some countries that weren't mentioned in the previous resources. However, since I trust the first two sources more than the last one, I won't take it into consideration. That said, it's important to gather additional resources to further elaborate on this information. If you're unsure whether using Tor is legal where you are located, it's always best to use a [VPN](../torthroughvpn/index.md) to secure yourself.

Most of these countries see Tor as a dangerous tool because it prevents governments from tracking users. And that's exactly why you should use it whenever possible. Your freedom should always be your top priority, as governments are constantly working to limit it.

### Real life example 

In 2012, an Iranian man was arrested for using Tor to bypass censorship and access websites that were blocked by the government. The government claimed that he was using Tor to access politically sensitive material and circumvent state surveillance. He was charged with violating Iran's cybercrime laws and allegedly engaging in espionage activities by using encryption and anonymity software. His case highlighted how authorities in Iran and other authoritarian regimes view Tor usage as an attempt to undermine their control over the internet.

## Monero

[Monero](../monerofirst/index.md) is an anonymous cryptocurrency that should be considered by anyone looking to participate in the parallel economy, especially for those wanting to protect their privacy and avoid government surveillance (Starve the parasit). Its focus on privacy and security makes it a powerful tool for individuals who want to keep their financial activities hidden from authorities. However, due to its strong anonymity features, some governments view Monero as a threat to their control over the economy. This has led many to push for Central Bank Digital Currencies [(CBDCs)](../prepareforCBDCs/index.md), which offer governments greater control over transactions and the ability to track and regulate all financial activity, stripping away privacy from individuals.

While CBDCs might be promoted as a means to enhance convenience or improve financial inclusion, they also represent a significant step toward centralized control, surveillance, and the potential for governments to restrict or control access to funds. In contrast, decentralized and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero provide individuals with an alternative to this centralized system, offering the freedom to participate in the economy without fear of government oversight.

![](monerologo.png)

As I did in the previous sections, I'll share a map showing where Monero is [illegal](https://old.reddittorjg6rue252oqsxryoxengawnmo46qy4kyii5wtqnwfj4ooad.onion/r/Monero/comments/w18ecg/cryptocurrency_is_illegal_in_27_countries/) or where the regulation is uncertain.

![](monero.png)

> As for Tor, defining where Monero is legal or not is a bit tricky as the regulation remains unclear. Anyway, the listed countries are known for their strong KYC politics that cannot be compliant with Monero. 

Many countries require individuals to report cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. Even in countries where Monero is not illegal, failing to report holdings of privacy coins can lead to tax evasion charges.

Some banks and payment processors, particularly in the European Union and the U.S., may refuse to engage with users involved in cryptocurrency transactions involving privacy coins like Monero due to their lack of traceability. That's where government control strikes again. 

![](banks.png)

### Real life example

As of now, there haven't been widely reported, specific cases where individuals have been jailed solely for using Monero. However, the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero is often closely monitored in countries where they are banned or heavily regulated. In such places, individuals can face legal issues related to the illegal use of cryptocurrencies rather than the mere use of Monero itself.

In countries like China, Russia, or India, individuals using Monero in illicit activities (such as money laundering or bypassing financial controls) might be targeted, and while specific examples of people jailed for Monero usage are sparse, law enforcement agencies track users of privacy coins due to their association with "illegal" markets.

![](china.png)

For instance:

**China's Crackdown on Privacy Coins (2021):** China banned all cryptocurrency transactions and mining in [2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20250722043819/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/business/china-cryptocurrency-bitcoin.html), and it was reported that authorities were specifically targeting privacy coins like Monero. Although there is no direct example of someone jailed solely for using Monero, the broader crackdown means those caught using Monero could face legal consequences.

**India's Cryptocurrency Regulation Debate (2021):** While Monero isn't outright banned in [India](https://lawbhoomi.com/cryptocurrency-laws-in-india/), the government was considering its regulation. Those caught using Monero for illegal activities could potentially face charges for violations of financial or cybercrime laws.

While there may not be highly publicized cases, authorities in such jurisdictions are likely to charge individuals using privacy coins for other crimes (such as money laundering or financing terrorism) rather than the mere use of Monero itself.

## SimpleX

SimpleX is a privacy-focused messaging platform that doesn't use user identifiers (like phone numbers or emails) and aims to provide anonymous, decentralized communication. It is not widely known worldwide, which helps it stay under the radar of most states for now.

![](simplex.png)

#### Current Legal Status

No countries have officially banned [SimpleX](../anonsimplex/index.md).

Some governments with strict censorship laws (e.g., China, Iran, North Korea) may block access to anonymous messaging services in general, including SimpleX, even if not named specifically in legislation.

SimpleX is quite resilient since one could self-host SMP server within the country rather easily.

#### Usage could be criminalized indirectly in

[Authoritarian](https://web.archive.org/web/20250807022418/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) regimes where use of encryption, anonymity tools, or unregistered communication platforms is discouraged or viewed with suspicion.

Countries with strong surveillance states (like Russia or Belarus) where tools used to bypass monitoring are often restricted.

![](regime.png)

#### Related Risks

If you're using SimpleX in a heavily surveilled country, the risk doesn't necessarily come from using SimpleX itself, but from:

- Bypassing censorship (VPNs, Tor, proxies)

- Accessing or sharing prohibited content

- Communicating anonymously when it's monitored


You are not breaking any laws in most countries by using SimpleX. In repressive regimes, using such tools might attract suspicion, even if they aren't formally banned.

Always assess your personal threat model and consider combining SimpleX with VPNs or Tor for additional safety if you're in a risky region.

Here's a map of countries with high internet surveillance or censorship that could potentially affect your ability to use tools like SimpleX:

![](simplx.png)

### Real life example

Awad bin Mohammed Al-Qarni, a prominent Saudi law professor and reformist author, was arrested and later charged by Saudi authorities for using WhatsApp (along with owning a X account) to share messages deemed "hostile" to the kingdom

Al-Qarni was accused of hostile actions against the state, including social media usage, clearly demonstrating that simply communicating via encrypted or private messaging platforms can lead to severe legal repercussions in some authoritarian contexts. 

This case illustrates how even mainstream encrypted messaging tools can be criminalized when used in politically sensitive contexts. It underscores the risks privacy-minded individuals face when governments criminalize digital communication freedom.

If you need to use this kind of tool while in a highly controlled area, make sure to use a [VPN](https://mullvad.net/en). 

## Conclusion

As you can see, some [governments](../stateistheenemy/index.md) are actively working to limit individual freedoms by making privacy tools illegal or associating them with so-called "illegal" activities. This is largely driven by their fear that people might adopt systems outside of state control, such as parallel economies, or spread anarchist and [agorist](../agorism/index.md) ideas. In many cases, the threat of punishment alone is enough to deter people from using these tools. However, some governments also implement technical blocks to ensure access is entirely restricted. [China](hhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250728182457/https://www.newsweek.com/china-online-identification-rights-free-speech-government-censorship-control-2099528) stands out as a prime example of an authoritarian regime with extensive internet surveillance and control over its population.
