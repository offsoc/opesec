Prerequisites:
- Get a house or apartment
- the bedroom must have a window


## How can I implement the solution ?

1) Order the blinds through the command-line to look cool:

```sh
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{ "title":"my_cool_order","item":"blinds", "id": 1}' \
      -X POST \
      https://thatonewebsitethatsellsblindsformonero.onion
```

2) once the package arrives, unpack it, and then screw it onto the wall
